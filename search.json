Student in Social Data Analytics & Research at the University of Texas at Dallas.\nI graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas in May 2023 with my Bachelor’s in Science in Business Administration, with a concentration in Innovation & Entrepreneurship. During my undergrad degree, I focused on many different elements of being an entrepreneur, such as sales and marketing, as well as testing the viability of new products and the estimated demand for it in a market.\nWith my masters degree, I am hoping to fine tune my research skills and use data analysis to help improve my abilities to be a great entrepreneur. Using this masters, I would be well equipped to research the demand of new technology needed in a community, and help bring that technology forth. I aspire to help push the world to grow in a well-mannered and ethical way by focusing on what people need to make their lives better in a day-to-day environment.\nClick here to view my resumé\nContact Me: jhanvi.kannan@utdallas.edu\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

    "text": "I used Google Trends and the gtrendsR Package to analyze data regarding the terms “Trump, Biden and Election”.\nWhen analyzing these terms on Google Trends, I noticed that the term “election” peaked on November 6, 2022, while the terms “Trump” and “Biden” stayed relatively stable all throughout 2022 and 2023. The term “Trump” had several hits around April and August of 2023, but it is safe to infer that it was not in correlation with the term “election”, as this was likely due to Trump’s presence in court cases at the time.\nUsing the gtrends package in R Studio yielded different results. The graph displayed by R studio shows that “Trump” was a popular term searched since 2005, but the term started picking up in search frequency around the 2016 election time. His next peak was in 2023, again likely due to his ongoing court cases. The term “election”, however was the most consistent in its peak, spiking every 4 years and then dying back down. It hit its all time peak this year in 2023, however, reaching a search frequency of 100 search hits. The term “Biden” had the lowest search hits, and had very minimal spikes in his trends.\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
