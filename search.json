    "text": "Hello! My name is Jhanvi Kannan, and I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas in May 2023 with my Bachelor’s in Science in Business Administration, with a concentration in Innovation & Entrepreneurship. During my undergrad degree, I focused on many different elements of being an entrepreneur, such as sales and marketing, as well as testing the viability of new products and the estimated demand for it in a market.\nWith my masters degree, I am hoping to fine tune my research skills and use data analysis to help improve my abilities to be a great entrepreneur. Using this masters, I would be well equipped to research the demand of new technology needed in a community, and help bring that technology forth. I aspire to help push the world to grow in a well-mannered and ethical way by focusing on what people need to make their lives better in a day-to-day environment.\nClick here to view my resumé\nClick here to view Project Proposal\nContact Me: jhanvi.kannan@utdallas.edu\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

This is asked before addressing the demographics of the sample population.\nThe questionnaire is composed of multiple choice questions (objective questions), as well as Likert Scales questions. This is used to collect data based on the opinions of the sample population.\nThe questions are ordered by starting with a Likert Scales question, that then continues into multiple choice questions based on the opinions of the topic.

    "text": "I used Google Trends and the gtrendsR Package to analyze data regarding the terms “Trump, Biden and Election”.\nWhen analyzing these terms on Google Trends, I noticed that the term “election” peaked on November 6, 2022, while the terms “Trump” and “Biden” stayed relatively stable all throughout 2022 and 2023. The term “Trump” had several hits around April and August of 2023, but it is safe to infer that it was not in correlation with the term “election”, as this was likely due to Trump’s presence in court cases at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the gtrends package in R Studio yielded different results. The graph displayed by R studio shows that “Trump” was a popular term searched since 2005, but the term started picking up in search frequency around the 2016 election time. His next peak was in 2023, again likely due to his ongoing court cases. The term “election”, however was the most consistent in its peak, spiking every 4 years and then dying back down. It hit its all time peak this year in 2023, however, reaching a search frequency of 100 search hits. The term “Biden” had the lowest search hits, and had very minimal spikes in his trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

    "text": "Biden-Xi Summit\nThe Biden-Xi summit was a virtual summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and was held on November 15 and 16, 2021. This summit was a critical diplomatic meeting between the leaders of the United States and China and aimed to address a range of important issues in the U.S.-China relationship, such as bilateral relations, economic and trade issues, human rights and climate change, regional and cyber security, and global issues such as COVID 19.\nWe used the provided R code and the Quanteda package to perform a text analysis on Twitter data regarding the Biden-Xi Summit. The following is what was identified from the analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line of code (head(tweet_dfm)) helps provide insight of the document terms in the data matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line of code (head(toptag, 10)) extracts the top 10 frequently used hashtags in the data matrix. As you can see, these hashtags are generically focused on the countries and presidents that the summit revolves around, but also touches on some global issues, such as COVID-19, drug usage, and the Uyghur Genocide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese lines of code (head(tag_fcm)) explores the relationship between the hashtags, and how they are used together. This image shows the analysis on the first few rows of hashtags, and how they correspond together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis network plot shows visually the relationship between the hashtags, and how they correspond with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line of code (head(topuser, 20)) extracts the top 20 frequent Twitter usernames found in the data matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image shows a network plot of a subset of Twitter usernames that were pulled from the data matrix, to show the visual relationship between usernames and their frequency of co-occurence in the matrix.\n\n\nU.S. Presidential Inaugural Speeches\nTo analyze Presidential Inaugural Speeches, I used the Quanteda package in R Studio to generate visualizations. The following is what I identified from my analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo retrieve this image, we used the code ’kwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = “american”) %&gt;%\ntextplot_xray().\nBy using this code, we perform a keyword-in-context analysis and specifically search for the word “american” in the data matrix. It then generates the visualization so we can see the frequency in which the term “american” was used in each president’s inaugural speeches.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use a similar code to derive this visualization, except we add in the functions to generate for the keywords “people” and “communist” as well. This visualization shows us how frequently each word was used in each president’s inaugural addresses, and how they compare to each of the other words as well.\nOver time and between presidents, the usage of the term “american” varied, but the usage of the term itself was not that high. The usage of the term “people” was a lot higher, and was used frequently in every president’s inaugural address.\n\n\nWhat is Wordfish?\nWordfish is a Quanteda Package function used in R Studio to analyze the relationship between words in documents. It is often used for text scaling, and will show the associated strength of each word within a document. To use this function, use ‘textstat_wordfish()’."
